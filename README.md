# Noughts and Crosses Game

### Overview

Noughts and Crosses, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This web-based version allows two players to play the game on a single device, with an option to restart the game at any time.


### Features

**Dynamic Game Board:** A 3x3 grid where players can click to mark their Nought or Cross.

**Player Indicators:** Displays which player's turn it is (Player 1 as O and Player 2 as X).

**Win Detection:** Automatically detects and announces the winner.

**Draw Detection:** Identifies a draw if all cells are filled with no winner.

**Game Restart:** Allows players to restart the game at any time.



### Development Notes

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, handling player turns, win/draw detection, and board state management.

CSS is used for styling the game board and providing visual feedback.

Bootstrap is utilized for responsive design and to enhance the UI components.
