# Noughts and Crosses Game

Overview
Noughts and Crosses, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic, simple game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This web-based version allows two players to play the game on a single device,
